    "Q--What is Python, and why is it popular\n",
    "\n",
    "A—python is a programming language with easy syntax and can be easily\n",
    "compiled. It is popular because iy=t can be learned easily and it is\n",
    "widely used in the field of modern technology like machine learning ,AI\n",
    ",web development etc….\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is an interpreter in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A—In Python, an **interpreter** is a program that reads and executes the\n",
    "code written in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What are pre-defined keywords in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A—Pre defined keywords in python are the pre decided words which already\n",
    "have some specific function and cannot be used by any user as it already\n",
    "have some specific task or work to perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--Can keywords be used as variable names\n",
    "\n",
    "A—No key words cannot be used as a variable name , as they already store\n",
    "some specific data..\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is mutability in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A—Mutabilty in python is defined as if the datatype can be modified or\n",
    "can be edited after execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable\n",
    "\n",
    "A—Lists are mutable in python because lists can be edited or cam be\n",
    "modified whereas tuples cannot be modified or be edited ..\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A--The == operator checks if the **values** of two objects are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The is operator checks if two objects are the **same object in memory**\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What are logical operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A—Python, logical operators are used to combine conditional statements\n",
    "and return a Boolean value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarly there are basically 3 main logoca operators in python and they\n",
    "are ….AND,OR,NOT.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is type casting in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A—type casting in python ca be defined as the process by which we can\n",
    "change or modify an value from one data type to another data type as per\n",
    "the requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
    "\n",
    "A—Implicit type casting can be defoned the type of data conversion in\n",
    "which the data gets converted into a particular data type by its own\n",
    "whereas explicit type casting a in python is the type of data conversion\n",
    "in which the user needs to give instruction for the data conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A—the main purpose of conditional statements in python is to detect a\n",
    "specific condition or task from a multiple task as per the desired\n",
    "requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--How does the elif statement work\n",
    "\n",
    "A--The elif statement in Python is short for \"else if\" and is used as\n",
    "part of a conditional structure to check multiple conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--What is the difference between for and while loops\n",
    "\n",
    "A--A for loop iterates over a sequence or range for a known number of\n",
    "times, while a while loop repeats as long as a condition remains True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q--Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for\n",
    "loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A—while loop can be suitable than for loop when we ae not sure about the\n",
    "range."
